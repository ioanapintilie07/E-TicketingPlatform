# E-TicketingPlatform

There are four main classes: Event, Location, Client, and Ticket. \
The project particularizes five types of events: Concert, Conference, Exhibition, Fundraiser and Play, all inheriting from class Event. \
Locations can be physical or online. Restrictions can be applied to an event by limiting the number of participants. Where that is not possible, events are moved to an online location. \
A client can check an event's availability and buy a ticket. In the case of fundraisers, they can also choose to make a donation.
